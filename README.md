This is my first project: Dubey's Calculator

This is a calculator that can do the following:

1.) Solve equation systems.

2.) Solve differential equations.

3.) Perform integration and differentiation for a given function.

4.) Matrix: multiplication, addition, subtraction, inverse, adjoint, determinant, fetch and 
solve characteristic equation for a matrix.

5.) Plot graphs for a given function.

6.) Convert units.

7.) Calculate area of various 2D, 3D shapes including 'n' sided regular polygon.

8.) Perform calculations related to 2D/3D lines, for example: Shortest distance between 2 skew lines, Shortest distance between 2 parallel lines, check if two lines are parallel.

9.) Perform basic vector calculations like dot product, cross product, vector triple product and vector cross product.

10.) Calculate capacitances of parallel plate capacitors, spherical capacitors and cylindrical capacitors.

11.) Check continuity and differentiability of function at a point.

12.) And not to forget, basic arithimetic like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Libraries used: 'tk' and 'sympy'

if any library is absent from your system then do not worry, the program will automatically check, download and install any missing library(ies) before starting.
You just need a python installation on your system.
